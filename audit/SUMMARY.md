- **Missing Features:** 103/121 (85%)
- **P0 Critical Issues:** 6
- **Estimated Time to Production:** 2-3 weeks

## Critical Path to Production

### Week 1 Priority Actions
1. Implement document ingestion pipeline
2. Set up evaluation framework
3. Add hybrid retrieval with reranking
4. Implement observability stack
5. Expand test coverage

### Quick Wins (Can implement today)
- Run `make setup` to initialize system
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
- Test ingestion with `python scripts/ingest.py`
- Run evaluation with `python scripts/eval.py`
- Execute benchmarks with `python scripts/bench.py`

## Key Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Development workflow
make dev          # Start development server
make test         # Run tests
make lint         # Check code quality

# Production operations
make serve        # Start production server
make ingest       # Ingest documents
make eval         # Run evaluation
make bench        # Run benchmarks
make backup       # Create backup

# Docker operations
make docker-build # Build image
make docker-up    # Start services
make health       # Check health
```

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸ”´ High Risk Areas
- No evaluation metrics (flying blind)
- No document ingestion (manual only)
- No hybrid retrieval (poor quality)
- No observability (cannot debug)
- Minimal tests (<10% coverage)

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Areas
- No caching (performance)
- No PII detection (compliance)
- No retry logic (reliability)
- Basic auth only (security)

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk Areas
- Docker support exists
- Clean architecture implemented
- Environment config present
- Basic vector store working

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Review all audit deliverables
2. Set up development environment with Makefile
3. Configure .env file with API keys
4. Run initial benchmarks for baseline

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Implement P0 issues from backlog
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Begin integration testing
4. Document API endpoints

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete all P0 and P1 issues
2. Achieve 80% test coverage
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Conduct load testing

## Success Criteria

Production readiness achieved when:
- [ ] All P0 issues resolved
- [ ] Evaluation metrics meet targets (Recall@10 > 0.85)
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] P99 latency < 2 seconds
- [ ] Full observability deployed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green
